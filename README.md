# Minesweeper
Minesweeper made with Python using Tkinter

To play using direct EXE, extract "Minesweeper EXE.rar" and click on dist\Minesweeper\Minesweeper.exe

To play/edit the Python code, the only pip add on required is PILLOW. There could have been more modules used to make it a lot easier but I chose to do it from basics as a complete exercise.

The images folder needs to be downloaded and stored in the same directory as the python file.

Enjoy!
